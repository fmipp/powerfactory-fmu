\section{Installation}
\label{sec:install}

\subsection*{Step~1: Download and extract}

To install the \fmipp \pf FMU Export Utility , proceed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Download the latest version as ZIP-file from the \href{http://sourceforge.net/projects/powerfactory-fmu/files/latest/download}{download page}.
  \item Unzip the installation file into any sub directory (referred to as the \emph{installation directory}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step~2: Running the installation script}

Installation requires to execute \python from the command prompt window, please refer to the \href{https://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html}{\python~FAQ} in case you need assistance with this.

Open the command prompt window, change to the installation directory and execute the script \texttt{powerfactory\_fmu\_install.py}:
\begin{verbatim}
python.exe powerfactory_fmu_install.py <pf_install_dir>
\end{verbatim}
where \texttt{<pf\_install\_dir>} is the path to your local \pf installation directory (for instance \texttt{C:\symbol{92}DIgSILENT\symbol{92}pf2016}).

After successful installation, the \pf installation directory contains two new files, \texttt{digexdyn.dll} and \texttt{digexfun1.dll}.


\subsection*{Step~3: Updating the Windows system path}

Finally, the \pf installation directory has to be added to the Windows system path. For instruction on how to do that please refer for instance \href{https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/94933-how-do-i-set-my-system-path-under-windows}{here}.
